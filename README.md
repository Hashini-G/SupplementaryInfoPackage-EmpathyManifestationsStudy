This is the supplementary information package of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering paper titled "Manifestations of Empathy in Software Engineering" authored by Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, and Ingo Mueller.

The study employed a multi-method qualitative approach, using Socio-Technical Grounded Theory for data analysis. We employed an interview study and a qualitative survey to explore the manifestations of empathy in SE including how practitioners define empathy in SE contexts and beyond, the motivations for demonstrating empathy, SE activities where empathy is perceived useful or unnecessary, and other factors that influence empathy of practitioners.

This repository contains,
  - Pre Interview Questionnaire
  - Interview Questions and
  - An example of STGT Analysis
  - Survey Questions

Researchers are invited to replicate the study. We appreciate receiving communication of the results through email (refer to the paper for contact details).
